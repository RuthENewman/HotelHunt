A React hotel searching application allowing a user to filter by facility.

The application uses filters JSON data for 10 hotels with 6 different facility types and renders the relevant hotels to the page.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

This means the following commands are available ('npm install' - to install local dependencies, 'npm init', 'npm start' to run the application, 'npm test', 'npm run build').

The git repository for a vanilla JavaScript version of this application is found here: https://github.com/RuthENewman/HotelHuntJS and is hosted on GitHub pages: https://ruthenewman.github.io/HotelHuntJS/

*NB: There is an issue with the React version for resetting the filtered hotels - any solutions / suggestions for this or other areas of improvement welcome to become a better developer.
